<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure relates generally to an adjustable closing system for an agricultural implement.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, agricultural implements are towed behind a work vehicle, such as a tractor. The agricultural implements generally contain a particulate material, such as seeds, fertilizer, and/or other agricultural product, which is distributed on or in the ground using various methods. For example, certain implements form a furrow in the ground, deposit a seed in the furrow, and then close the furrow over the seed. In some instances, the agricultural implement may not properly form or close the furrow due to soil texture and other soil properties. Improper forming or closure of the furrow may diminish seed germination, extend emergence time, and reduce crop yield.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One or more specific embodiments of the present disclosure will be described below. In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, all features of an actual implementation may not be described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present disclosure, the articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;the,&#x201d; and &#x201c;said&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. Any examples of operating parameters and/or environmental conditions are not exclusive of other parameters/conditions of the disclosed embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure include an adjustable closing system for an agricultural implement. Certain agricultural implements (e.g., harvesters, tillers, seeders, and planters) are towed by a work vehicle and are configured to open a furrow in a field, deposit a seed, and close the furrow. For example, certain agricultural implements include row units that form furrows along rows of the field, deposit seeds in the furrows, and close the furrows. However, certain furrow conditions may inhibit seed germination and emergence rates, such as inadequate coverage of the seed with moist soil, excessive contact of the seed with residue, excessive presence of air gaps in the furrow, inadequate seed-to-soil contact, and excessive soil compaction around the seed (e.g. insufficiently mellow soil which may inhibit seedling emergence rates). Additionally, soil tightness may be understood as a quality of the seedbed that affects the ability of the row unit to adequately close the furrow and properly cover the seed with moist and mellow soil (e.g., a quality of the seedbed that resists closure of the furrow). The agricultural implement described herein may facilitate germination of the seed and growth of the plant. More specifically, the agricultural implement may include an adjustable closing system capable of adjusting the position of one or more discs (e.g., closing discs). For example, the closing discs may be longitudinally offset relative to one another, laterally offset relative to one another, as well as oriented in other ways. By adjusting the position (e.g., the longitudinal offset and/or the lateral offset) and orientation (e.g., angle(s) relative to the soil) of the closing discs, the adjustable closing system is able to respond to different conditions, such as the soil tightness, to facilitate seed germination and emergence.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the position and/or the orientation of the closing discs may be adjusted in response to feedback from one or more sensors. For example, the implement may include one or more sensors that detect soil tightness, one or more other soil conditions (e.g., moisture content, soil flow, soil compaction, soil structure, soil texture, depth of the furrow, etc.), position(s) of the closing disc(s) with respect to the soil, the furrow formed by an opening system, or a combination thereof. The sensors may also detect operation of the planter (e.g., operational conditions) such as operating speed of vehicle (e.g., tractor), vibration, temperature, rotational speed, rotational position, strain, etc. Such operational conditions may also include position(s), orientation(s), and/or pressure(s) applied to controllable components of a row unit of the planter. As a controller receives sensor feedback about the soil tightness, the other soil conditions, and/or the operational conditions of the agricultural equipment, the controller may instruct various actuators to adjust the position and/or the orientation of the discs. For example, the controller may adjust the position and/or the orientation based on the soil tightness as detected by the sensors. Additionally or alternatively, the controller may determine the soil tightness based on the feedback from the sensors (e.g., based on a depth of the discs and a pressured applied to the discs by an actuator) and adjust the position and/or the orientation based on the soil tightness. Such adjustments may facilitate covering the seeds with moist and mellow soil, thereby facilitating seed germination and emergence.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">With the foregoing in mind, the present embodiments relating to adjustable closing systems may be utilized within any suitable agricultural system. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of an agricultural implement <b>10</b> (e.g., a planter). To facilitate discussion, the implement <b>10</b> and certain components of the implement <b>10</b> may be described with reference to a vertical axis or direction <b>20</b>, a longitudinal axis or direction <b>21</b>, and a lateral axis or direction <b>22</b>. The implement <b>10</b> may be towed behind a work vehicle (e.g., a tractor) in a direction <b>19</b> generally along the longitudinal axis <b>21</b>. The implement <b>10</b> includes a tongue assembly <b>12</b>, which is shown in the form of an A-frame hitch assembly. The tongue assembly <b>12</b> may include a hitch used to attach to an appropriate vehicle hitch via a ball, clevis, or other coupling. For example, a tongue of the implement <b>10</b> may be connected to a drawbar of the work vehicle, or a mast of the implement may be connected to a 3-point hitch of the work vehicle. The tongue assembly <b>12</b> is coupled to a tool bar <b>14</b> which supports multiple row units <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain embodiments, each row unit <b>16</b> may include an opening system coupled to a chassis of the row unit <b>16</b> and configured to engage soil to form a furrow for seed deposition. The row unit <b>16</b> may also include a gauge wheel assembly movably coupled to the chassis. The gauge wheel assembly may include a gauge wheel configured to rotate across a soil surface to limit a penetration depth of the opening discs into the soil. Additionally, each row unit <b>16</b> may include an adjustable closing system that closes the furrow formed by the opening system (e.g., after seed deposition). As will be explained below, the agricultural implement <b>10</b> may include one or more sensors that detect soil tightness, other soil conditions, and/or operational conditions of agricultural equipment, and in response, adjust the position and/or the orientation of the one or more closing discs to facilitate closing of the furrow.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view of an exemplary row unit <b>16</b> that may be employed within the agricultural implement <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As illustrated, the row unit <b>16</b> includes elements <b>18</b> of a parallel linkage assembly, also known as a four-bar linkage, configured to couple the row unit <b>16</b> to the tool bar <b>14</b>, while enabling vertical movement of the row unit <b>16</b>. In addition, a down force actuator <b>23</b> extends between a mounting bracket <b>24</b> and a lower portion of the parallel linkage <b>18</b> to establish a contact force between the row unit <b>16</b> and soil <b>25</b>. The down force actuator <b>23</b> is configured to apply a force to the row unit <b>16</b> in a downward direction (e.g., along the vertical axis <b>20</b>), thereby driving a ground engaging tool into the soil <b>25</b>. As will be appreciated, a desired level of down force may vary based on soil tightness, soil type, the degree of tillage applied to the soil, soil moisture content, amount of residue cover, a speed of the agricultural implement, weight of the row unit <b>16</b>, and/or tool wear, among other factors. Because such factors may vary from one side of the implement <b>10</b> to the other, a different level of down force may be selected for each row unit <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In certain embodiments, the down force actuator <b>23</b> may be coupled to a controller <b>88</b> configured to automatically regulate the pressure within the down force actuator <b>23</b> to maintain a desired contact force between the ground engaging tools and the soil. Because each row unit <b>16</b> includes an independent down force actuator <b>23</b>, the contact force may vary across the implement <b>10</b>, thereby establishing a substantially uniform seed deposition depth throughout the field. In some embodiments, the down force actuator <b>23</b> may retract to apply an upward force. For example, in some environments, the planter may work with light soils when the weight of the row unit <b>16</b> itself is excessive for the amount of downforce needed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the present embodiment, the parallel linkage elements <b>18</b> are pivotally coupled to a chassis <b>26</b> and a frame <b>28</b>. In some embodiments, the chassis <b>26</b> and the frame <b>28</b> may be one-piece or integral (e.g., cast as one-piece). The frame <b>28</b> may be configured to support various elements of the row unit <b>16</b> such as a metering system and a product storage container, for example. As illustrated, the chassis <b>26</b> supports an opening system <b>30</b>, an adjustable closing system <b>32</b>, and a residue manager system <b>34</b>. In the present configuration, the opening system <b>30</b> includes a gauge wheel assembly <b>36</b> having a gauge wheel <b>38</b> and a rotatable arm <b>40</b> which functions to movably couple the gauge wheel <b>38</b> to the chassis <b>26</b>. The gauge wheel <b>38</b> may be positioned a vertical distance D above an opening disc <b>42</b> of the opening system <b>30</b> to establish a desired furrow depth for seed deposition into the soil <b>25</b>. As the row unit <b>16</b> travels across a field, the opening disc <b>42</b> forms a furrow in the soil <b>25</b>, and seeds are deposited into the furrow. The down force actuator <b>23</b> is configured to adjust the penetration depth D of the opening disc <b>42</b> by varying a position of the gauge wheel <b>38</b> relative to the chassis <b>26</b>. While the opening system <b>30</b> is illustrated with a single opening disc <b>42</b>, it should be appreciated that alternative embodiments may include a pair of opening discs positioned on opposite sides of the chassis and adjacent to a corresponding pair of gauge wheels. In such configurations, the opening discs may be angled toward one another to establish a wider furrow within the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Seeds may be deposited within the furrow via a seed tube extending between a metering system within the frame <b>28</b> and the soil <b>25</b>. The seed tube exit may be positioned aft of the opening system <b>30</b> and forward of the closing system <b>32</b> along the longitudinal axis such that seeds flow into the furrow. As illustrated, the closing system <b>32</b> includes a closing assembly <b>44</b> and a press wheel assembly <b>46</b>. The closing assembly <b>44</b> includes a closing disc <b>48</b> configured to fracture and generate a flow of soil into the furrow. The closing system <b>32</b> includes a bar <b>47</b> extending between the chassis <b>26</b> and the closing disc <b>48</b> (e.g., between the chassis <b>26</b> and a bar <b>49</b> coupled to the closing disc <b>48</b>). A closing disc actuator <b>50</b> is coupled to the bar <b>47</b> of the closing system <b>32</b> and is configured to regulate a contact force between the closing disc <b>48</b> and the soil <b>25</b>. For example, a large contact force may be applied to effectively push tighter soil into the furrow, while a relatively small contact force may be applied to close a furrow with loose soil. In some embodiments, a large contact force may be applied so that the closing disc <b>48</b> penetrates the soil <b>25</b> and achieves a proper depth of engagement. While the view illustrates one closing disc <b>48</b>, it should be appreciated that the closing assembly <b>44</b> may include a pair of closing discs <b>48</b>. Additionally, certain embodiments may employ closing wheels instead of the illustrated closing disc <b>48</b>. In some embodiments, the closing disc <b>48</b> may be a cutting disc that actually cuts into the soil <b>25</b> to drive soil into the furrow. Accordingly, the actuator <b>50</b> may provide the force to drive the closing disc <b>48</b> into the soil <b>25</b> a distance <b>52</b>. In some embodiments, the closing system <b>32</b> may include additional actuators that enable the closing system <b>32</b> to adjust the orientation and/or position of the closing disc <b>48</b> (e.g., a geometry of the closing system <b>32</b>) in response to detected soil tightness, soil conditions, and/or operational conditions of the agricultural implement <b>10</b> (e.g., of the row unit <b>16</b>). Such operational conditions of the row unit <b>16</b> may include position(s), orientation(s), and/or pressure(s) applied to controllable components of the row unit <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As illustrated, the closing system <b>32</b> includes an actuator <b>56</b> coupled to the bar <b>49</b> that enables the closing system <b>32</b> to adjust the position of the closing disc <b>48</b> relative to another disc(s) (e.g., closing disc) generally along the longitudinal axis <b>21</b>. As such, the closing system <b>32</b> enables adjustment of the closing disc <b>48</b> with respect to another closing disc and/or with respect to another portion of the row unit <b>16</b> based on a soil condition and/or an operational condition. The closing system <b>32</b> also includes an actuator <b>58</b> that enables adjustment of the closing disc <b>48</b> relative to another closing disc along the lateral axis <b>22</b>. That is, the actuator <b>58</b> may increase a width between the closing disc <b>48</b> and another closing disc(s) on an opposite side of the furrow. The closing system <b>32</b> may also include actuator(s) that adjust the camber, castor, and/or toe of the closing disc <b>48</b>. In certain embodiments, the actuator <b>56</b> may enable the closing system <b>32</b> to adjust the position of the closing disc <b>48</b> relative to another closing disc along the lateral axis <b>22</b>, and/or the actuator <b>58</b> may enable the closing system <b>32</b> to adjust the position of the closing disc <b>48</b> relative to another closing disc along the longitudinal axis <b>21</b>. The ability to adjust the geometry of the closing system <b>32</b> enables the one or more row units <b>16</b> to facilitate a desired seed to soil contact during planting operations by the agricultural implement <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As illustrated, the press wheel assembly <b>46</b> includes a press wheel <b>72</b> positioned aft of the closing disc <b>48</b> that serves to pack soil deposited on top of the seeds by the closing disc <b>48</b>. In the present embodiment, the press wheel assembly <b>46</b> includes an arm <b>74</b> extending between the chassis <b>26</b> and the press wheel <b>72</b>. A press wheel actuator <b>76</b> is coupled to the arm <b>74</b> of the press wheel assembly <b>46</b>, and is configured to regulate a contact force between the press wheel <b>72</b> and the soil. For example, in dry conditions, it may be desirable to firmly pack soil directly over the seeds to seal in moisture. In damp conditions, it may be desirable to leave the soil over the seeds fairly loose to avoid compaction which may result in soil crusting. The process of excavating a furrow into the soil, depositing seeds within the furrow, closing the furrow and packing soil on top of the seeds establishes a row of planted seeds within a field. By employing multiple row units <b>16</b> distributed along the tool bar <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, multiple rows of seeds may be planted within the field.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Additionally, the row unit <b>16</b> includes the residue manager system <b>34</b> configured to prepare the soil <b>25</b> before seed deposition. As illustrated, the residue manager system <b>34</b> includes a residue manager <b>78</b> coupled to the chassis <b>26</b> by an arm <b>80</b>. The residue manager <b>78</b> includes points or fingers <b>82</b> configured to break up or move aside crop residue on the soil surface. In other words, the residue manager system <b>34</b>, may reduce and/or block deposition of residue in the seed furrow which may affect seed germination and emergence. A residue manager actuator <b>84</b> extends from a bracket <b>86</b> to the arm <b>80</b> of the residue manager system <b>34</b>, and is configured to regulate a contact force between the residue manager <b>78</b> and the soil. While a single residue manager <b>78</b> is shown in the present embodiment, it should be appreciated that alternative embodiments may include a pair of residue manages angled toward one another.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each of the actuators discussed above (e.g., <b>23</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>76</b>, <b>84</b>) may be controlled by a controller <b>88</b> of the agricultural implement and the row unit <b>16</b> to facilitate opening a furrow, closing the furrow, and then packing soil deposited over the furrow in a way that facilitates seed germination and growth. That is, the controller <b>88</b> coordinates operation of the actuators in response to detected soil tightness, soil conditions, and/or operating conditions of the agricultural implement <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated, the controller <b>88</b> may include a processor <b>90</b>, a memory <b>91</b>, and a user interface <b>92</b>. The controller <b>88</b>, via the processor <b>90</b>, may receive one or more signals from one or more sensors <b>94</b>. For example, the processor <b>90</b> may be a microprocessor that executes software to control the various actuators on the row unit <b>16</b> in response to feedback from the sensors <b>94</b>. The processor <b>90</b> may include multiple microprocessors, one or more &#x201c;general-purpose&#x201d; microprocessors, one or more special-purpose microprocessors, and/or one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), or some combination thereof. For example, the processor <b>90</b> may include one or more reduced instruction set (RISC) processors.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The memory <b>91</b> may include a volatile memory, such as random access memory (RAM), and/or a nonvolatile memory, such as read-only memory (ROM). The memory <b>91</b> may store a variety of information and may be used for various purposes. For example, the memory <b>91</b> may store processor executable instructions, such as firmware or software, for the processor <b>90</b> to execute. The memory may include ROM, flash memory, a hard drive, or any other suitable optical, magnetic, or solid-state storage medium, or a combination thereof. The memory may store data, instructions, and any other suitable data.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The user interface <b>92</b> may display values associated with the adjustable closing system <b>32</b> and the row unit <b>16</b> to an operator of the agricultural implement and/or may enable interaction between the operator and the adjustable closing system <b>32</b> and the row unit <b>16</b>. For example, the user interface <b>92</b> may display values (e.g., the soil tightness) detected by the sensors <b>94</b>, may display values (e.g., the soil tightness) determined by the controller <b>88</b> based on the feedback from the sensors <b>94</b>, may include certain options selectable by the operator for the controlling the closing system <b>32</b>, may include certain options selectable by the operator for the controlling the row unit <b>16</b>, or a combination thereof. Additionally, the user interface <b>92</b> may display values and/or may enable interaction with each row unit <b>16</b> of the agricultural implement.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As described above, the sensors <b>94</b> may detect soil tightness, other soil conditions, and/or operating conditions of the agricultural implement (e.g., the closing disc <b>48</b> and the row unit <b>16</b>). For example, the sensors <b>94</b> may include soil tightness sensors configured to detect the soil tightness via ground penetrating RADAR, multispectral reflectivity of the soil, and/or other methods that may directly detect soil tightness. In certain embodiments, the sensors <b>94</b> may include soil condition sensors configured to detect other conditions of the soil and/or operational sensors configured to detect operation of the row unit <b>16</b> and/or the agricultural equipment. For example, the sensors <b>94</b> may include LIDAR, infrared sensors, optical cameras, accelerometers (e.g., to detect vibration), a gyroscope (e.g., to detect orientation: camber, castor, toe), position sensors (e.g., to detect placement of components relative to row unit frame/chassis), a disc position sensor (e.g., to detect a vertical and/or general position of the disc relative to the soil, relative to another disc, relative to the chassis <b>26</b> or the frame <b>28</b>, or a combination thereof), a disc rotational position sensor (e.g., to detect whether the disc rate of rotation is within expected limits to determine whether the disc is stuck, dragging, sliding, failing, not fully engaged with the ground), a torsion sensor (e.g., to detect rolling resistance to determine whether the disc is stuck, dragging, sliding, failing, not fully engaged with the ground), a draft sensor (e.g., to detect deflection due to forces on ground engaging components), or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In certain embodiments, the controller <b>88</b> may determine the soil tightness, among other soil conditions/characteristics, based on the feedback from the sensors <b>94</b>. For example, the controller <b>88</b> may receive a signal from the sensor <b>94</b> indicative of the position of the closing disc <b>48</b> with respect to the soil <b>25</b> and/or with respect to the chassis <b>26</b> or other portions of the row unit <b>16</b> (e.g., the sensor <b>94</b> may be an infrared sensor or another type of sensor configured to detect the position of the closing disc <b>48</b> relative to the soil <b>25</b> and/or relative to the chassis <b>26</b> or other portions of the row unit <b>16</b>). Additionally, the controller <b>88</b> may be configured to determine a pressure applied by an actuator (e.g., the actuator <b>50</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, or a combination thereof) of the closing system <b>32</b> to the closing disc <b>48</b> and/or may receive a sensor signal indicative of the pressure applied by the actuator to the closing disc <b>48</b> (e.g., a sensor may be coupled to the actuator <b>50</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, or a combination thereof and may be configured to output a sensor signal indicative of the pressure applied by the actuator <b>50</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, or a combination thereof). In certain embodiments, sensor(s) may be disposed on or within the bar <b>47</b> and/or the bar <b>49</b> and may be configured to output sensor signals indicative of the position of the closing disc <b>48</b> with respect to the soil <b>25</b> and/or with respect to the chassis <b>26</b> or other portions of the row unit <b>16</b>. Based on the position of the closing disc <b>48</b> with respect to the soil <b>25</b>, the chassis <b>26</b>, the frame <b>28</b>, or a combination thereof, and based on the pressure applied to the closing disc <b>48</b>, the controller <b>88</b> may determine the tightness of the soil <b>25</b>. In some embodiments, the controller <b>88</b> may determine the tightness of the soil <b>25</b> based on feedback from ground penetrating RADAR, and other sensors configured to detect soil tightness.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">By way of example, a position sensor may be coupled to the bar <b>47</b> and/or to the actuator <b>50</b> and may be configured to output the sensor signal indicative of the position of the closing disc <b>48</b> with respect to the soil <b>25</b> and/or with respect to the chassis <b>26</b> or other portions of the row unit <b>16</b>. Additionally, a sensor may be coupled to the actuator <b>50</b> and may be configured to output a sensor signal indicative of the pressure applied by the actuator <b>50</b> to the closing disc <b>48</b>. Based on the position of the closing disc <b>48</b> with respect to the soil <b>25</b> and/or with respect to the chassis <b>26</b> or other portions of the row unit <b>16</b> and based on the pressure applied by the actuator <b>50</b> to the closing disc <b>48</b>, the controller <b>88</b> may determine the soil tightness. For example, the soil tightness may be proportionally related to the position of the closing disc <b>48</b> and/or to the pressure applied to the closing disc <b>48</b>, and the controller <b>88</b> may refer to reference tables to determine a soil tightness that corresponds to the position of the closing disc <b>48</b> and/or the pressure applied to the closing disc <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Based on the soil tightness (e.g., the soil tightness sensed by the sensors <b>94</b> and/or determined by the controller <b>88</b> based on the feedback from the sensors <b>94</b>), the controller <b>88</b> may execute instructions stored in the memory <b>91</b> via the processor <b>90</b> to control the actuators of the row unit <b>16</b> to control the movement of soil into the furrow and/or soil compaction around the furrow. For example, if the soil tightness is relatively high, the controller <b>88</b> may adjust a relative position and/or geometry of the closing disc <b>48</b> via the actuator <b>50</b>, the actuator <b>56</b>, the actuator <b>58</b>, or a combination thereof, to increase penetration and/or breakup of the soil <b>25</b>. If the soil tightness is relatively low, the controller <b>88</b> may adjust a relative position and/or geometry of the closing disc <b>48</b> via the actuator <b>50</b>, the actuator <b>56</b>, the actuator <b>58</b>, or the combination thereof, to reduce drag on the row unit <b>16</b> causes by the closing system <b>32</b>. In certain embodiments, the controller <b>88</b> may control the press wheel actuator <b>76</b> to control the force of the press wheel <b>72</b> on the soil covering the furrow. In this way, the controller <b>88</b> may reduce soil compaction around the seed and increase oxygen flow to the seed. In some embodiments, the controller <b>88</b> may adjust a position of and a pressure applied to the gauge wheel assembly <b>36</b> and the opening disc <b>42</b> via the actuator <b>23</b> and/or a position of and a pressure applied to the residue manager <b>78</b> via the actuator <b>84</b> based on the soil tightness.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As the soil tightness changes, the sensors <b>94</b> may detect the changing soil tightness and/or the controller <b>88</b> may determine the changing soil tightness, and in response, the controller <b>88</b> may adjust one or more of the actuators of the row unit <b>16</b> (e.g., the actuators <b>23</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, and <b>76</b>). Specifically, the controller <b>88</b> may adjust the position and/or the orientation of the closing disc <b>48</b> via the actuator <b>50</b>, the actuator <b>56</b>, the actuator <b>58</b>, or the combination thereof. The adjustments to the closing disc <b>48</b> may enable the closing system <b>32</b>, and the row unit <b>16</b> and the agricultural implement generally, to react to the changing soil tightness and facilitate closure of the furrow after deposition of the seed. As such, the adjustable closing system <b>32</b> may facilitate seed planting and germination.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a side view of the adjustable closing system <b>32</b>. As described above, the adjustable closing system <b>32</b> includes closing discs <b>48</b> that drive soil into the furrow, thereby covering the deposited seeds with soil. As illustrated, the adjustable closing system <b>32</b> includes two closing discs <b>48</b>. In certain embodiments, the closing system <b>32</b> may include more closing discs (e.g., three closing discs, four closing discs, etc.). The closing discs <b>48</b> may be coupled to the chassis of the row unit via the bars or linkages <b>49</b> that extend between the chassis and the closing discs <b>48</b>. In some embodiments, the closing discs <b>48</b> may be cutting discs that cut into the soil <b>25</b> to drive soil into the furrow formed by the opening system <b>30</b> (e.g., the closing discs <b>48</b> may have cutting surfaces configured to cut into the soil <b>25</b>). In certain embodiments, the closing discs <b>48</b> may be press wheels (e.g., V-press wheels) that drive soil into the furrow by pressing down on the surface of the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As described above, the adjustable closing system <b>32</b> and the row unit <b>16</b> generally may adjust the position of the closing discs <b>48</b> in response to the soil tightness to facilitate seed germination and emergence. For example, the controller <b>88</b> may actuate the actuators <b>50</b> to adjust a downward force on the closing discs <b>48</b> in a direction <b>100</b> and/or to adjust relative positions of the closing discs <b>48</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the controller <b>88</b> may actuate the actuators <b>56</b> to adjust the downward force on the closing discs <b>48</b> in a direction <b>102</b> and/or to adjust the relative positions of the closing discs <b>48</b>. The adjustment in force in the directions <b>100</b> and/or <b>102</b> may enable the closing discs <b>48</b> to penetrate a distance <b>52</b> into the soil <b>25</b> to drive soil into the furrow excavated by the opening system <b>30</b>. The actuators <b>50</b> and <b>56</b> may operate together or independently. Further, because each closing disc <b>48</b> is controlled with respective actuators <b>50</b> and/or <b>56</b>, the distance <b>52</b> that each closing disc <b>48</b> penetrates the soil <b>25</b> may be controlled independently. For example, in response to feedback from the sensors <b>94</b> (e.g., based on the soil tightness), the controller <b>88</b> may adjust how far each of the closing discs <b>48</b> penetrates into the soil <b>25</b> (e.g., the distance <b>52</b>). That is, a first closing disc <b>48</b> may penetrate the soil <b>25</b> a greater amount than a second closing disc <b>48</b> to facilitate covering the furrow with soil. An increase in the downward force may also enable the closing discs <b>48</b> to cut farther into soil types with a higher soil tightness (e.g., clay, wet soil).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated, the closing discs <b>48</b> are offset from one another along the longitudinal axis <b>21</b> by a longitudinal distance <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the actuators <b>50</b> and/or <b>56</b> may adjust the relative positions of the closing discs <b>48</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>21</b> (e.g., the distance <b>110</b>) to control soil movement into the furrow. For example, in response to feedback from the sensors <b>94</b> (e.g., based on the soil tightness), the controller <b>88</b> may, via control signals output to the actuators <b>50</b> and/or <b>56</b>, move one or both closing discs <b>48</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>21</b> to adjust the distance <b>110</b>. As illustrated, contraction and/or extension of the bar <b>47</b> and/or of the bar <b>49</b> enables the closing discs <b>48</b> to move along the longitudinal axis <b>21</b>. In certain embodiments, the distance <b>110</b> may be between about four inches and about zero inches. In other embodiments, the distance <b>110</b> may be between about six inches and about zero inches, between about eight inches and about zero inches, between about eight inches and about two inches, between about six inches and about two inches, or other suitable distances. As such, the controller <b>88</b> is configured to adjust the distance <b>110</b> based on the feedback from the sensors <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As illustrated, the closing discs <b>48</b> are coupled to the bars <b>49</b> via axles <b>114</b>. Additionally, the closing system <b>32</b> includes the sensors <b>94</b> coupled to the axles <b>114</b>. As described above, the sensors <b>94</b> may be configured to detect the position of the closing discs <b>48</b> relative to the soil <b>25</b>. For example, a respective sensor <b>94</b> coupled to the axle <b>114</b> may be configured to detect a generally vertical distance <b>120</b> between the axle <b>114</b> and the soil <b>25</b>. As such, the sensors <b>94</b> may be optical sensors, infrared sensors, RADAR, LIDAR, other sensors configured to detect the positions of the closing discs <b>48</b> relative to the soil <b>25</b> (e.g., the distance <b>120</b> between the axle <b>114</b> and the soil <b>25</b>), or a combination thereof. Based on the distance <b>120</b> and the pressure applied to the closing discs <b>48</b> via the actuators <b>50</b> and/or <b>56</b>, the controller <b>88</b> may determine the soil tightness and may control the position and/or the orientation of the closing discs <b>48</b> based on the soil tightness.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a rear view of an embodiment of an adjustable closing system <b>32</b>.

For example, the controller <b>88</b> is configured to adjust an angle <b>130</b> and an angle <b>132</b> of the closing discs <b>48</b> with respect to the soil <b>25</b> via the actuators <b>56</b>. As the actuators <b>56</b> move the bars <b>49</b> along axis/directions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b>, the respective angles <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> adjust with respect to the soil <b>25</b>.

Additionally or alternatively, the closing discs <b>48</b> may be actuated independent of each other to enable the closing system <b>32</b> to place the closing discs <b>48</b> at generally the same angle or different angles with respect to each other. By adjusting the angle of the closing discs <b>48</b> with respect to the soil <b>25</b>, may facilitate closure of a furrow <b>140</b> with soil in different planting conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a rear view of an embodiment of an adjustable closing system <b>32</b>.

For example, the actuators of the closing system <b>32</b> (e.g., the actuators <b>56</b> and the other actuators described above) enable the closing discs <b>48</b> to be adjusted relative to one another along the longitudinal axis <b>21</b> (e.g., in the direction of travel), adjusted relative to one another along the lateral axis <b>22</b> (e.g., in a direction orthogonal or substantially orthogonal to the direction of travel), as well as adjusted relative to one another via an angular displacement of the closing discs <b>48</b> relative to the soil <b>25</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the closing system <b>32</b> that enables displacement of the closing discs <b>48</b> relative to the furrow <b>140</b> and to each other along the lateral axis <b>22</b>. As illustrated, a distance <b>141</b> between the closing discs <b>48</b> (e.g., a lateral distance) may be adjusted via the actuators <b>56</b>. The distance <b>141</b> may be between about six inches and about zero inches, between about four inches and about zero inches, between about six inches and about two inches, between about six inches and about four inches, between about two inches and about one inch, or other suitable distances.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In operation, the controller <b>88</b> receives feedback from one or more sensors <b>94</b> that detect the soil tightness, and/or the controller <b>88</b> determines the soil tightness based on the feedback from the sensors. Based on the soil tightness, the controller <b>88</b> controls operation of the actuators of the closing system (e.g., the actuators <b>56</b> and/or the other actuators described above) to adjust the distance <b>141</b> between the closing discs <b>48</b>. For example, to adjust the position of the closing discs <b>48</b> in directions <b>142</b> and/or <b>144</b>, the controller <b>88</b> actuates actuators <b>56</b> coupled to the bars <b>49</b>. As the actuators <b>56</b> move the bars <b>49</b> in the directions <b>142</b> and/or <b>144</b>, the lateral position of the closing discs <b>48</b> relative to each other and to the furrow <b>140</b> may change (e.g., the distance <b>141</b> may change). Additionally or alternatively, the closing discs <b>48</b> may be actuated independent of each other to enable the closing system <b>32</b> to place the closing discs <b>48</b> at different positions relative to the furrow <b>140</b>. For example, one of the closing discs <b>48</b> may be closer to the furrow <b>140</b> than the other closing disc <b>48</b>. By adjusting the position of the closing discs <b>48</b> relative to the furrow <b>140</b> and relative to one another (e.g., the distance <b>141</b>), the controller <b>88</b> is able to facilitate closure of the furrow <b>140</b> based on the soil tightness.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a rear view of an embodiment of an adjustable closing system <b>32</b>. As described herein, the closing system <b>32</b> may enable independent movement of the closing discs <b>48</b> in response to the soil tightness detected by the sensors <b>94</b> and/or in response to the soil tightness determined by the controller <b>88</b> based on the feedback from the sensors <b>94</b>. For example, as illustrated, the closing system <b>32</b> includes actuators <b>150</b> that enable rotation of the closing discs <b>48</b> with respect to one another and with respect to the furrow <b>140</b>. The actuators <b>150</b> are coupled to the bars <b>49</b>, and the controller <b>88</b> is configured to actuate the actuators <b>150</b> to rotate the bars <b>49</b> in the directions <b>152</b> and/or <b>154</b>, thereby rotating the closing discs <b>48</b>. As such, the actuators <b>150</b> may rotate the bars <b>49</b> in the directions <b>152</b> and/or <b>154</b> to rotate the closing discs <b>48</b> in the directions <b>152</b> and/or <b>154</b>. For example, the actuators <b>150</b> may rotate the closing discs <b>48</b> between 90 degrees in either direction (e.g., +/&#x2212;90 degrees). Additionally or alternatively, the closing discs <b>48</b> may be actuated independent of each other to enable the closing system <b>32</b> to place the closing discs <b>48</b> at symmetric or asymmetric angles relative to the furrow <b>140</b>. The ability to rotate the closing discs <b>48</b> may facilitate closure of the furrow <b>140</b> based on the soil tightness.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow diagram of an embodiment of a process <b>160</b> for controlling the adjustable closing system. For example, the process <b>160</b>, or portions thereof, may be performed by the controller of the adjustable closing system and of the row unit. The process begins at block <b>162</b>, where operating parameter inputs are received. The operating parameter inputs may include a general type of soil, a speed of the row unit and/or of the agricultural implement, weather conditions, certain soil conditions, or a combination thereof. The operating parameter inputs may be received via the user interface of the controller of the adjustable closing system and/or may be stored in the memory of the controller.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At block <b>164</b>, the agricultural implement is towed through the field. As the agricultural implement is towed, the row units of the agricultural implement engage the soil of the field. For example, the opening discs of the row units engage the soil to open the furrows in the field, the row units deposit the seeds into the furrows, and the adjustable closing system, via the closing discs and/or the press wheel, push the soil into the furrows to close the furrows and/or to compact the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At block <b>166</b>, the sensors of the adjustable closing system and the row unit sense the soil tightness, the soil conditions, the operational conditions, or a combination thereof. For example, as described herein, the sensors may include soil tightness sensors configured to detect the soil tightness via ground penetrating RADAR, multispectral reflectivity of the soil, and/or other methods that may directly detect soil tightness. In certain embodiments, the sensors may include soil condition sensors configured to detect other conditions of the soil and/or operational sensors configured to detect operation of the row unit and/or the agricultural equipment. For example, the sensors may include LIDAR, infrared sensors, optical cameras, accelerometers (e.g., to detect vibration), a gyroscope (e.g., to detect orientation: camber, castor, toe), position sensors (e.g., to detect placement of components relative to row unit frame/chassis), a disc position sensor (e.g., to detect a vertical and/or general position of the disc relative to the soil and/or relative to another disc), a disc rotational position sensor (e.g., to detect whether the disc rate of rotation is within expected limits to determine whether the disc is stuck, dragging, sliding, failing, not fully engaged with the ground), a torsion sensor (e.g., to detect rolling resistance to determine whether the disc is stuck, dragging, sliding, failing, not fully engaged with the ground), a draft sensor (e.g., to detect deflection due to forces on ground engaging components), or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">At block <b>168</b>, the controller of the adjustable closing system and of the row unit receives the feedback from the sensors indicative of the soil tightness (e.g., receive the feedback from the soil tightness sensors indicative of the soil tightness) and/or determines the soil tightness based on the feedback from the sensors (e.g., may determine the soil tightness, among other soil conditions/characteristics, based on the feedback from the soil condition sensors and/or from the operational sensors). For example, the controller may receive a signal from the sensor indicative of the position of the closing disc with respect to the soil and/or with respect to portion(s) of the row unit (e.g., the sensor may be an infrared sensor or another type of sensor configured to detect the position of the closing disc relative to the soil). Additionally, the controller may be configured to determine a pressure applied by an actuator of the closing system to the closing disc and/or may receive a sensor signal indicative of the pressure applied by the actuator to the closing disc. Based on the position of the closing disc with respect to the soil and/or with respect to the portion(s) of the row unit and based on the pressure applied to the closing disc, the controller may determine the tightness of the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At block <b>170</b>, based on the soil tightness (e.g., the soil tightness sensed by the sensors and/or determined by the controller based on the feedback from the sensors), the controller controls a position and/or an orientation of one or both closing discs. For example, the controller may output signals to the actuators coupled to the closing discs (e.g., via bars) to adjust the position and/or the orientation of the closing discs. In response, the actuators may adjust the position (e.g., the longitudinal position and/or the lateral position) and/or the orientation (e.g., the angle with respect to the soil and/or the furrow) of one or both closing discs. Additionally or alternatively, at block <b>172</b>, the controller may, via the user interface, notify the operator of the agricultural implement of the soil tightness. After completing block <b>170</b> and/or block <b>172</b>, the process <b>160</b> may return to block <b>166</b> to sense the soil tightness, the soil conditions, the operational conditions, or a combination thereof</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Accordingly, the adjustable closing system and the row unit including the adjustable closing system described herein may improve operation of an agricultural implement via adjustment of the closing system based on a tightness of soil engaged by the row unit. For example, the row unit may include sensors that detect the soil tightness and/or other conditions (e.g., soil conditions and/or operational conditions). The sensors may output signals to a controller of the row unit and of the adjustable closing system. The controller may receive the signals indicative of the soil tightness from the sensors and/or may determine the soil tightness based on the feedback from the sensors. Based on the soil tightness, the controller may control the adjustable closing system to adjust a position and/or an orientation of one or both closing discs of the closing system. For example, the controller may control a longitudinal position of the closing discs relative to one another, a lateral position of the closing discs relative to one another, an angle of the closing discs relative to the soil and/or relative to a furrow formed by the row unit, or a combination thereof. The adjustments to the closing system may improve performance of the closing system. For example, the adjustments may enable the closing system to better fill the furrow with soil, cover a seed within the furrow with soil, reduce drag on the row unit, and other benefits associated with operation of the agricultural implement. The improved seed coverage may improve seed germination and crop production.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to an arrangement for attaching a working tool to a working machine as defined in the preamble of claim <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Preferably, the solution according to the invention also comprises a quick hitch suitable for use as a universal quick hitch between a three-point hitch of a working machine, such as a tractor, and an implement, hereafter referred to as a working tool, to be attached to the tractor. Thus, the quick hitch preferably acts as an adapter. The arrangement of the invention also makes it easier to attach the quick hitch to the three-point hitch of the working machine. Similarly, it also makes it easier to directly attach a working tool to the three-point hitch of the working machine when no quick hitch is needed between the working tool and the working machine. The solution according to the invention is useful in agriculture and any other operation where a working tool attached to a working machine needs to be changed repeatedly.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The universal quick hitch for a working machine used in the arrangement according to the invention makes it easier and faster to attach a working tool to the working machine. When the working machine is a tractor, the working tool is often attached to a rear linkage of the tractor, often called a tractor three-point hitch.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The tractor three-point hitch is a widely used type of linkage between a tractor and a working tool. An ordinary tractor three-point hitch comprises two lower pulling arms, one upper pushing arm as well as one or more lift cylinders which usually are hydraulically driven. The lower pulling arms may also be called draw links or lift arms, and the upper pushing arm may also be called a top link.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The position of the coupling elements of the working tools to be attached to the tractor may vary between different working tools. The attaching points of the coupling elements of the working tools often are provided at different heights and widths from each other. The tractor three-point hitch must be adjustable in different ways and easy-to-use to allow a variety of working tools to be attached thereto. The widths and other dimensions of the coupling elements of the implements and working tools to be attached to the three-point hitch, positioned at the rear, and sometimes at the front, of the tractor, are not always standardized, and, there are many different standard sizes as well. Therefore, when attaching a tractor three-point hitch to implements, the coupling elements often need to be adjusted to each other before they can be connected together. In prior-art solutions, the operator of the tractor usually has to get out of the tractor to be able adjust the coupling elements of the three-point hitch of the tractor to match the coupling elements of the working tools.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The connecting dimensions according to the different categories result, for example, in that a working tool of Category 2 cannot be attached to a working machine of Category 1 or Category 3. Besides, especially larger working machines often have a robust and heavy three-point hitch pushing arm, possibly making it hard and dangerous, or even impossible, to manually lift and lower it in order to connect a quick hitch or a working tool to the pushing arm. The solution according to the invention aims at eliminating the need of the operator to get out of the working machine in order to adjust the position of the coupling elements of the three-point hitch to match, both in the height direction and in the horizontal direction, with the coupling elements of the working tool or the quick hitch. According to the solution of the invention, the operator of the working machine is able to adjust the positions of the coupling elements of the three-point hitch, manually from the cabin, without leaving his seat, thereby not only making the work easier but also safer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">Background of the Invention and Problems Related to the Prior Art</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As is known, often the problem is that, so far, the dimensions of working tools intended for working machines generally have not been standardized, and, therefore, the manufacturers have each used their own dimensions for layout and positioning of the coupling elements. This has been enabled by the wide adjustability of the three-point hitch of the tractor to match various implements and working tools, but, a drawback encountered has been the need of the operator to get out of the tractor in order to adjust the position of the coupling elements of the three-point hitch to match the coupling elements of the working tool. It can be hard to get out of the working machine for the adjustment if the operator constantly needs to change the implement of his working machine. This has also shown to be a security risk because the operator, or his assistant, needs to move between the working machine and the implement to be attached thereto while the engine of the working machine is running.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Solutions for attaching a three-point hitch to a quick hitch, having a fixed structure and not allowing the distance between the fastening elements to be adjusted in the width direction, are known. A quick hitch like this only can accommodate matching implements which follow its dimensions. A more advanced design than this is known from the U.S. Pat. No. 3,312,478.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This solution allows the horizontal distance between the lower hooks of the quick hitch to be adjusted to match the attaching points of the working tool. This solutions suffers from the drawback that the adjustment is manual, the adjustment handle being located down on the quick hitch, far away from the operator, making it impossible for the operator to reach the adjustment handle from the cabin, and, consequently, the operator has to step down to the ground between the working machine and the working tool for the width adjustment. This is a difficult task, possibly involving a security risk, as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A more contemporary solution is known from the European patent application No. EP3138373A1. A drawback of this solution is that the structure has a fixed width, not allowing for any adjustment of the mutual horizontal distance of the lower hooks or the coupling hooks of the quick hitch. No other than implements and working tools having a matching width can be attached to this quick hitch. Besides, in this solution, the lower hooks or the couplings only can be seen to a restricted extent. This can be a major disadvantage when attaching a working machine to an implement by driving.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There are some other known solutions which also suffer from the problem that the lower hooks of the legs of the quick hitch are poorly visible for the operator. The visibility of the lower hooks is substantially important when attaching a working machine to an implement by driving. Attaching the working machine to the implement requires driving accuracy from the operator of the working machine because the alignment of the lower hooks with the coupling elements of the implement can be a matter of centimeters. The lower hooks of the three-point hitch of the working machine are coupled to the coupling elements of the implement after an appropriate approach and accurate driving lines. When approaching the implement, the driving lines of the working machine must be within the range of the coupling elements as the implements, because of their heaviness, rarely are movable by human power. The solution according to the invention avoids the visibility problem by designing the structure to incline forward so as not to hide the lower hooks in the field of view of the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The current prior-art quick hitch solutions do not allow working tools having attaching points with varying widths to be attached to a three-point hitch of a working machine, such as a tractor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">This invention aims at overcoming the above-mentioned drawbacks and providing a flexible, efficient, fast and unnoticeable as well as easy-to-use arrangement for connecting a working tool or a universal quick hitch between a working machine, such as a tractor, and the working tool or the universal quick hitch. The solution according to the invention also aims at making the work of the operator of the working machine, such as the operator of the tractor, easier, at increasing work safety by mechanizing the adjustment of the coupling elements of the three-point hitch and by making it easier to attach the working machine, such as the tractor, to the working tool.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The quick hitch employed by the solution according to the invention can be regarded as a type of adjustable adapter, enabling various implements and working tools attachable to working machines, such as a tractor, to be attached to the tractor without getting out of the tractor. Besides, the arrangement assists the operator of the working machine in attaching the heavy pushing arm of the three-point hitch to the working tool or the quick hitch. The arrangement according to the invention is characterized in what is set forth in claim <b>1</b>. The other embodiments of the invention are characterized in what is set forth in the rest of the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A typical arrangement according to the invention for attaching a working tool to a working machine, preferably to a three-point hitch of the working machine, comprising a pushing arm articulated, at one end, to the working machine and two pulling arms articulated, at one end, to the working machine comprises a coupling mechanism for attaching the three-point hitch, from the cabin of the working machine, to the working tool, or, to a quick hitch positioned between the working tool and the working machine.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A typical universal quick hitch, intended for a working machine, for attaching working tools to a three-point hitch of the working machine, and employed in the arrangement according to the invention comprises a frame, two legs with a lower hook, an upper hook as well as a width adjustment mechanism for adjusting, from the cabin of the working machine, the mutual distance between the lower hooks in the width direction.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Advantages of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention makes it easier to attach a working machine, such as a tractor, to various working tools and provides better circumstances for work safety, by allowing the attaching to be carried out from the cabin, without the need of the operator, or his assistant, to step into the unsafe area between the working machine, such as the tractor, and the implement or the working tool.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The quick hitch preferably included in the arrangement according to the invention is a universal, preferably mechanically operable quick hitch acting as an adapter, enabling implements and working tools, having their coupling elements positioned in different ways, to be safely attached, from the cabin of a working machine, to the three-point hitch of the working machine.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Compared to the above-mentioned known solutions, the adjustability of the width of the fastening elements of the employed quick hitch, without having to get out of the working machine, and the mechanical implementation of the adjustment, can also be seen as an advantage. Besides, the quick hitch included in the arrangement according to the invention is laterally movable, resulting in a better alignment with the coupling elements, such as fastening pins, of the working tool.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another advantage is that the pushing arm of the three-point hitch is safe and easy to mount, from the cabin of the working machine, to the fastening element of the working tool or the quick hitch.</p>

In structures where the upper hook <b>41</b> travels along a curved path, the support arms <b>41</b><i>c </i>are connected to the support structure <b>3</b><i>a </i>by a joint <b>40</b>. To move the upper hook <b>41</b>, the quick hitch <b>1</b> comprises a driving element or actuator <b>27</b>, such as a hydraulic cylinder connected to the hydraulic system of the working machine and preferably fitted between the frame <b>3</b> and the support arms <b>41</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The latch mechanism <b>4</b> of the quick hitch <b>1</b> comprises the upper latch <b>42</b> connected to the upper hook <b>41</b> and moving jointly with the upper hook <b>41</b>, with a disengaging mechanism <b>41</b><i>a </i>adapted to be operated by using a pulling means <b>41</b><i>b</i>, such as a chain, rope or rod, the pulling means <b>41</b><i>b </i>extending to the cabin, or to close proximity thereof, in order to allow the operator of the working machine to release the upper latch <b>42</b>, from the cabin of the working machine. The disengaging mechanism <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the upper latch <b>42</b> is articulated to the upper hooks <b>41</b>, the upper latch <b>42</b> being adapted to be engaged by a spring force and to be disengaged by means of a lever included in the disengaging mechanism <b>41</b><i>a</i>, and of the pulling means <b>41</b><i>b</i>, against the spring force.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The latch mechanism <b>4</b> also comprises two lower latches <b>43</b> for locking the quick hitch <b>1</b> to the lower fasteners of the working tool, a length-adjustable latch releaser <b>44</b>, a disengaging rod <b>45</b> provided inside each leg <b>31</b> for each lower latch <b>43</b>, and a release mechanism <b>46</b> for the lower latches <b>43</b>, positioned between the upper hook <b>41</b> and the latch releaser <b>44</b>, to transmit the movement of the upper hook <b>41</b> to the lower hooks <b>43</b> for the purpose of engaging and disengaging the lower latches <b>43</b>. The latch mechanism <b>4</b> comprises locking springs <b>45</b><i>a </i>for locking the lower latches <b>43</b> to the lower fasteners of the working tool. The release mechanism <b>46</b> of the lower latches <b>43</b> is adapted to pull the latch releaser <b>44</b> and the disengaging rods <b>45</b>, which are connected thereto, upwards when the upper hook <b>41</b> is turned to its upper position. This disengages the lower latches <b>43</b>, against the spring force.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The width adjustment mechanism <b>5</b> of the lower hooks <b>32</b> comprises a first lever mechanism <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and a locking element <b>53</b> for locking the mutual horizontal distance between the lower hooks <b>32</b> in the width direction. The width adjustment mechanism <b>5</b> is adapted to move the legs, through the first lever mechanism <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, and, at the same time, the lower hooks <b>32</b>, in a mutually synchronized manner in the width direction of the quick hitch <b>1</b>, either simultaneously farther away from each other, or simultaneously closer to each other, and at an identical speed with respect to each other, as well as over an equally long distance. The width adjustment mechanism <b>5</b> is adapted to be operated from the cabin of the working machine and is preferably connected to the hydraulic system of the working machine but it may as well be connected to the transmission system of the working machine or to the electrical system of the working machine. Alternatively, the quick hitch <b>1</b> may comprise a manual actuation means operable from the cabin of the working machine.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The locking element <b>53</b> for the width adjustment comprises a locking arm <b>54</b> and a locking counterpart <b>55</b> provided with locking apertures, the locking head of the locking arm being adapted to be locked, at the locking phase of the width adjustment, into these apertures. The locking counterpart <b>55</b> is fastened to the first leg <b>31</b> of the quick hitch <b>1</b>, to be jointly movable with the leg <b>31</b>. The locking arm <b>54</b> is articulated, at its first end, to the first lever mechanism <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, the locking arm <b>54</b> thus moving in the width direction of the quick hitch <b>1</b> as the mutual distance between the legs <b>31</b> is adjusted, and the locking portion of the locking head, provided in the second end of the locking arm <b>54</b>, being insertable, at the locking phase, into the apertures of the locking counterpart <b>55</b> aligned to the locking portion of the locking head. For clarity, the actuator for engaging and disengaging the locking arm <b>54</b> is not shown in the Figures.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The locking element <b>53</b> is adapted to lock the structure at a desired grip width. The locking portion of the locking element <b>53</b> is adapted to be pressed down into the slot-like apertures of the locking counterpart <b>55</b> and, thereby, to prevent any unintentional change of the grip width.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The grip width of the quick hitch <b>1</b>, i.e. the horizontal distance between the lower hooks <b>32</b>, is adapted to be adjusted by means of the motive power of the hydraulic first lateral stopper <b>22</b> and the counteracting second locked lateral stopper <b>24</b>. The second lateral stopper is a metal rod, for example, fixed at its first end and its second end to the frame of the working machine and to the pulling arm <b>21</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The lateral movement of the first lateral stopper <b>22</b> at the first leg <b>31</b> of the quick hitch <b>1</b> is adapted to be transmitted, through the first lever mechanism <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, into a movement changing the distance between the both legs <b>31</b>, and thereby, also the distance between the lower hooks <b>32</b>, when the second lateral stopper <b>24</b> is connected to the second pulling arm <b>21</b> to provide counterforce to the first lateral stopper <b>22</b>. The first width adjustment element <b>52</b>, such as the upper spreading arm herein, is connected at its first end to the first leg <b>31</b> of the quick hitch <b>1</b> and its second end to the first end of the rocker arm <b>51</b>. The second, the lower width adjustment element <b>52</b>, such as the lower spreading arm herein, is connected at its first end to the second leg <b>31</b> of the quick hitch <b>1</b> and its second end to the second end of the rocker arm <b>51</b>. The rocker arm <b>51</b> is articulated, between its ends, to the frame <b>3</b> to turn around its joint.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The movement of the first lateral stopper <b>22</b> at the second leg <b>31</b> of the quick hitch <b>1</b> is also adapted to move the entire quick hitch <b>1</b> in the lateral direction. This operation is enabled by locking the locking element <b>53</b> and by unlocking the second lateral stopper <b>24</b>, for example by disconnecting the second lateral stopper <b>24</b> from the pulling arm <b>21</b> with the result that the counterforce of the second lateral stopper <b>24</b> does not restrict the lateral movement of the quick hitch <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The lower latches <b>43</b> of the quick hitch <b>1</b> are adapted to be disengaged by the movement of the upper hook <b>41</b>. The movement of the upper hook <b>41</b> is adapted to be transmitted to the lower latch <b>43</b> by means of a movement transmitted by the second release mechanism <b>46</b>, the length-adjustable latch releaser <b>44</b> and the disengaging rod <b>45</b>. The release mechanism <b>46</b> of the lower latches <b>43</b> connected to the structure of the upper hook <b>41</b> is adapted to cause a lifting movement for the latch releaser <b>44</b> once the release mechanism <b>46</b> has moved to its uppermost extreme position.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this embodiment, the lower latches <b>43</b> allow the quick hitch <b>1</b> also to be used as a two-point hitch. Since the lower latches <b>43</b> lock the lower hooks <b>32</b>, a reliable attachment is achieved also when the upper hook <b>41</b> is not engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a second quick hitch <b>1</b> according to the invention where the upper portion of the latch mechanism <b>4</b> differs from the above-described structure for the support structure of the upper hook <b>41</b>. In this embodiment, the upper hook <b>41</b> does not turn around a joint but is provided on the support structure <b>3</b><i>a </i>which, now, is a substantially straight supporting and guiding post which guides the linear movement of the upper hook <b>41</b> and which is provided with sliding and guiding surfaces <b>50</b> and along which the upper hook <b>41</b> is adapted to move up and down. The movement of the upper hook <b>41</b> is adapted to be transmitted to the lower latches <b>43</b> by a release mechanism <b>46</b> similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

The driving element <b>22</b><i>a </i>is adapted to change the distance between the lower hooks <b>32</b> of the quick hitch <b>1</b>. In order to synchronize the width adjustment for both legs <b>31</b>, the width adjustment mechanism <b>5</b> comprises a first lever mechanism <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and a locking member <b>53</b> which are substantially similar to those described above.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The driving element <b>22</b><i>a </i>can also be connected to the legs <b>31</b> of the quick hitch <b>1</b> at its both ends.</p>

With the exception of the structure of the upper hook <b>41</b> and the support structure <b>3</b><i>a </i>thereof, the quick hitch <b>1</b> can be and operate in a manner substantially similar to that described above.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Thus, the difference from the above is the structure of the upper hook <b>41</b>, with the support arms and the locking device <b>48</b>, as well as the support structure <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the upper hook <b>41</b>, comprising a substantially straight locking post, provided with guiding surfaces <b>50</b> and having a substantially straight locking rail <b>49</b> with locking slots <b>499</b> disposed above each other in the height direction.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The locking device <b>48</b> is a separate component of the structure acting as a double locking mechanism and is installed in its place around the support structure <b>3</b><i>a </i>together with the upper hook <b>41</b>. The locking device <b>48</b> comprises a locking plate <b>488</b>, a stepped wedge <b>489</b>, and a frame <b>48</b><i>a </i>that has an upper part <b>48</b><i>b</i>, a lower part <b>48</b><i>d </i>and a connection part <b>48</b><i>c </i>whose upper end is fastened to the upper part <b>48</b><i>b </i>of the frame <b>48</b><i>a </i>and whose lower end is fastened to the lower part <b>48</b><i>d </i>of the frame <b>48</b><i>a</i>. Further, the upper part <b>48</b><i>b </i>comprises two slots, one for the locking plate <b>488</b> and the other for the stepped wedge <b>489</b>. The distance between the lower edge of the upper part <b>48</b><i>b </i>and the upper edge of the lower part <b>48</b><i>d </i>is greater than the length of the frame part <b>41</b><i>h </i>of the upper hook <b>41</b>. In that case the upper hook <b>41</b> with its frame part <b>41</b><i>h </i>can be movably installed between the upper part <b>48</b><i>b </i>and the lower part <b>48</b><i>d </i>of the frame <b>48</b><i>a </i>of the locking device <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The locking plate <b>488</b> and stepped wedge <b>489</b> are adapted to restrict, by means of a counterpart <b>487</b> fastened to the frame part <b>41</b><i>h </i>of the upper hook <b>41</b>, the movement of the upper hook <b>41</b> to be shorter than the distance between the locking slots <b>499</b>. The stepped wedge <b>489</b> and the locking plate <b>488</b> are adapted to lock the upper hook <b>41</b> in a locking slot <b>499</b> of the locking post of the support structure <b>3</b><i>a</i>, at a desired distance from the lower hooks <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The locking device <b>48</b> is adapted to provide, together with the upper hook <b>41</b>, a clamping force for clamping the fastening pins of the working tool, attached to the quick hitch <b>1</b>, between the upper hook <b>41</b> and the lower hooks <b>32</b>. The locking device <b>48</b> is adapted to be locked in the locking slot <b>499</b> of the locking rail <b>49</b> of the locking post by means of the locking plate <b>488</b>. The stepped wedge <b>489</b> is adapted to adjust the distance between the upper hook <b>41</b> and the lower hook <b>32</b>, with a sufficient accuracy, to match the fastening elements of the working tool, the quick hitch <b>1</b> and the working tool then forming a locked joint. No latch structure <b>4</b> is needed in this solution to ensure the attachment of the working tool.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The upper hook <b>41</b> can move up and down between the locking slots <b>499</b> when the stepped wedge <b>489</b> is open.

The lower end of the release handle <b>61</b> locks, by means of the locking holes <b>65</b> of the arm <b>62</b>, the length of the lateral stopper <b>24</b>. An upward pulling of the release handle <b>61</b> lifts the lower end of the release handle <b>61</b> out of the locking hole to release the length locking between the arm <b>62</b> and the frame <b>63</b>.

Both handles <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>54</b><i>a </i>are positioned to be reachable for the operator of the working machine, from the cabin of the working machine. The horizontal distance between the legs <b>31</b> of the quick hitch <b>1</b> is adjusted by turning the first handle <b>51</b><i>a </i>in the width direction of the quick hitch <b>1</b>, and the width position is locked by turning the locking arm <b>54</b> to its locking position, by means the second handle <b>54</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The main difference between the supporting and guiding structure of the upper hook <b>41</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> and the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is that the structure now comprises a lever mechanism <b>41</b><i>f </i>for manually releasing the upper latch <b>42</b> from the cabin of the working machine.

For clarity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> are simplified and they do not show all the structural parts.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A joint <b>11</b> connects the pushing arm <b>23</b> of the three-point hitch <b>1</b><i>a</i>, at the first end thereof, to the rear part <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the working machine, for example. Likewise, the pulling arms <b>21</b> are articulated, at their first ends, to the rear part <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the working machine. In many, especially larger working machines, the pushing arm <b>23</b> can be very heavy, making it difficult and dangerous, or even impossible, to move it, by hand, in the vertical plane. Therefore, accurate positioning of the free end, i.e. the second end, of the pushing arm <b>23</b> into the fastening element <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the working tool, or the quick hitch <b>1</b>, can be a complicated task. Preferably, the arrangement according to the invention comprises said separate lifting and lowering mechanism <b>6</b> for moving the pushing arm <b>23</b>, substantially in the vertical plane.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The lifting and lowering mechanism <b>6</b> comprises a hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b> acting as a driving element or actuator and connected, at the first end of the cylinder part, by means of a joint <b>12</b>, to the rear part <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the working machine, above the pushing arm <b>23</b> and preferably in the same vertical plane as the longitudinal vertical plane of the pushing arm <b>23</b>. Preferably, the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b> can be smaller, more lightweight and shorter than the pushing arm <b>23</b>. The free end of the piston rod of the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b> is provided with a first gripping member <b>8</b>, preferably an annular member forming a closed loop and extending, from the end of the piston rod, down towards the pushing arm <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Correspondingly, the upper surface of the pushing arm <b>23</b> is provided with a second gripping member <b>23</b><i>b </i>adapted to act as a counterpart of the first gripping member <b>8</b>. Preferably, the second gripping member <b>23</b><i>b </i>has a substantially round cross-section and is adapted to be curved, from the upper surface of the pushing arm towards the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b>, and, at the same time, away from the rear part <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the working machine. The second gripping member <b>23</b><i>b </i>is adapted to fit through the loop of the first gripping member <b>8</b> as the lifting and lowering mechanism <b>6</b> is connected to the pushing arm <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The joint <b>11</b> of the pushing arm <b>23</b> at the rear part <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the working machine is positioned lower and, with respect to the longitudinal direction of the pushing arm <b>23</b>, further outwards than the joint <b>12</b> of the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b> of the lifting and lowering mechanism <b>6</b>. Thus, the mutual positioning of the joints <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> is geometrically chosen so that, as the piston rod of the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b>, which is connected to the gripping member <b>23</b><i>b </i>of the pushing arm, is pulled inwards, the pulling force causes a force component directed substantially upwards and forcing the pushing arm <b>23</b> to turn, around its joint <b>11</b>, towards the above hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b>, which, in turn, at the same time turns around its joint <b>12</b>, substantially upwards. Correspondingly, as the piston rod of the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b>, which is connected to the gripping member <b>23</b><i>b </i>of the pushing arm <b>23</b>, is pushed outwards, the gravity pulls the pushing arm <b>23</b> to turn around its joint <b>11</b>, substantially downwards. At the same time, the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b> connected to the gripping member <b>23</b><i>b </i>turns around its joint <b>12</b>, substantially downwards.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The lifting and lowering mechanism <b>6</b> is also provided with a spring element <b>10</b>, or a similar element, adapted to lift the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b> upwards, away from top of the pushing arm <b>23</b>, when the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b> is not connected to the gripping member <b>23</b><i>b </i>of the pushing arm. The spring element <b>10</b> can be an extension spring, for example, connected between the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b> and the rear part <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the working machine.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Preferably, the lifting and lowering mechanism <b>6</b> is also provided with a handle <b>9</b> allowing the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b> to be laterally moved when connecting the first gripping member <b>8</b> with respect to the second gripping member <b>23</b><i>b</i>. When the hydraulic cylinder <b>7</b> is connected to the pushing arm <b>23</b>, the handle also allows the pushing arm <b>23</b> to be laterally moved. This is helpful especially when the pushing arm <b>23</b> is connected to the quick hitch <b>1</b>, or to a working tool without the quick hitch <b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The principal idea of the invention is to make it faster, and in general, possible to safely attach various implements and working tools to a three-point hitch of a working machine, such as a tractor. Thus, one of the main ideas is to allow the three-point hitch and its hooks to be easily and safely operated from the cabin of the working machine in order to accurately lower the pushing arm of the three-point hitch, even if it is heavy, by means of the coupling mechanism, to the right position on a fastening element of the a working tool, or of a quick hitch serving as an adapter, and in order to lift it away therefrom. Besides, in a preferred arrangement, the coupling mechanism comprises pulling and transmission means, such as flexible ropes or chains or appropriately designed rods and/or lever mechanisms, allowing the attaching of the three-point hitch to the working tool or to the quick hitch to be managed in a controlled way, for instance by unlocking the quick coupling hooks of the three-point hitch. Preferably, the pushing, pulling and transmission means are adapted to be operated from the cabin of the working machine.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Further, a preferred idea is to facilitate an arrangement allowing the grip width of the quick hitch <b>1</b> to be changed from the cabin of the working machine. The width adjustment mechanism <b>5</b> according to the invention and the locking element <b>53</b>, as well as the actuators of the width adjustment mechanism <b>5</b>, such as the hydraulic cylinders <b>22</b> and <b>22</b><i>a </i>and/or, the manual actuators, such as the handles <b>51</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>e </i>and <b>41</b><i>g</i>, with their lever mechanisms, constitute means for adjusting the mutual horizontal distance between the lower hooks <b>32</b>, from the cabin of the working machine, and, at the same, form part of the coupling mechanism of the arrangement according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The structure and actuators of the coupling mechanism of the arrangement according to the invention, as well as the number thereof, are adapted to vary case by case. For instance, some of the actuators of the coupling mechanism, such as the above-mentioned width adjustment mechanism <b>5</b> of the quick hitch <b>1</b>, with its actuators, are incorporated in the quick hitch <b>1</b>, thus only forming part of the coupling mechanism when the quick hitch <b>1</b> is used. Correspondingly, the above-mentioned lifting and lowering mechanism <b>6</b> of the pushing arm <b>23</b> only forms part of the coupling mechanism of the arrangement according to the invention when the lifting and lowering mechanism <b>6</b> is installed on the working machine.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the solution according to the invention, in common to all the locking and opening or unlocking mechanisms for locking latches of the hooks of the pushing arm and the pulling arms is the fact that the lever mechanisms and/or wire mechanisms are guided and/or shielded so that they are secure, safe and reliable to use from the cabin of the working machine, and that they do not get entangled with other structures of the working machine, three-point hitch or working tools causing damages to itself or to other components.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that different embodiments of the invention are not solely restricted to the above-described examples but may vary within the accompanying claims. Besides, the solutions described in the different examples may vary between the different exemplary solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">It is also obvious to the person skilled in the art that the structure of the release mechanism of the lower latches may differ from that described above. Instead of a lever mechanism, the release mechanism may comprise a chain, rope or any other structure resilient in another direction and only transmitting a force in the pulling direction when the upper hook is lifted.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">It is also obvious to the person skilled in the art that the arrangement may comprise a separate rack which can hold the quick hitch and from which it can easily be lifted away, by means of the three-point hitch, and to which it also can be lowered back when no longer needed. The rack allows the quick hitch to be held at an appropriate height off the ground, thus making it easier to fasten the pulling arms of the three-point hitch to the pins of the fastening elements of the three-point hitch, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">It is also obvious to the person skilled in the art that the structure of the lifting and lowering mechanism of the pushing arm may differ from that described above. As an example, the first gripping member of the hydraulic cylinder of the lifting and lowering mechanism can be a hook-shaped, almost straight pin, and, correspondingly, the second gripping member of the pushing arm can be an annular member allowing the hook-shaped pin of the first gripping member to be inserted through it.</p>
